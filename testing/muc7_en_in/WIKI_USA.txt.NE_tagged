 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States of America</ENAMEX>(also called the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>, America, and the States) is a federal constitutional republic comprising fifty states and a federal district. 
The country is situated mostly in central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>, where its forty-eight contiguous states and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington, D.C.</ENAMEX>, the capital district, lie between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Oceans</ENAMEX>, bordered by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>to the north and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>to the south. 
The state of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>is in the northwest of the continent, with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>to the east and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>to the west, across the Bering Strait. 
The state of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. 
The country also possesses several territories in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>. 
At 3.79 million square miles (9.83 million km2) and with over 312 million people, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>is the third or fourth largest country by total area, and the third largest by both land area and population. 
It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>economy is the world's largest national economy, with an estimated 2011 GDP of $15.1 trillion (22% of nominal global GDP and over 19% of global GDP at purchasing-power parity). 
Indigenous peoples descended from forebears who migrated from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>have inhabited what is now the mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>for many thousands of years. 
This Native American population was greatly reduced by disease and warfare after European contact. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>was founded by thirteen British colonies located along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>seaboard. 
On July 4, 1776, they issued the Declaration of Independence, which proclaimed their right to self-determination and their establishment of a cooperative union. 
The rebellious states defeated the British Empire in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Revolution</ENAMEX>, the first successful colonial war of independence. 
The current <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787; its ratification the following year made the states part of a single republic with a strong central government. 
The Bill of Rights, comprising ten constitutional amendments guaranteeing many fundamental civil rights and freedoms, was ratified in 1791. 
Through the 19th century, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>displaced native tribes, acquired the Louisiana territory from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX>from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>, part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oregon</ENAMEX>Country from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>, Alta California and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Mexico</ENAMEX>from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>, and annexed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>and the Republic of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>. 
Disputes between the agrarian South and industrial North over the expansion of the institution of slavery and states' rights provoked the Civil War of the 1860s. 
The North's victory prevented a permanent split of the country and led to the end of legal slavery in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>. 
By the 1870s, its national economy was the world's largest. 
The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a military power. 
It emerged from World War II as the first country with nuclear weapons and a permanent member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations Security Council</ENAMEX>. 
The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>left the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>as the sole superpower. 
The country accounts for 41% of global military spending, and is a leading economic, political, and cultural force in the world.

In 1507, German cartographer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Waldseemüller</ENAMEX>produced a world map on which he named the lands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Hemisphere</ENAMEX>"America" after Italian explorer and cartographer Amerigo Vespucci. 
The former British colonies first used the country's modern name in the 1776 Declaration of Independence, the "unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America". 
On November 15, 1777, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Continental Congress</ENAMEX>adopted the Articles of Confederation, which states, "The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States of America'</ENAMEX>." 
The Franco-American treaties of 1778 used " <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>", but from July 11, 1778, " <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States of America</ENAMEX>" was used on the country's bills of exchange, and it has been the official name ever since. 
The short form " <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>" is also standard. 
Other common forms include the " <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>", the "USA", and "America". 
Colloquial names include the "U.S. of A." and, internationally, the "States". 
"Columbia", a once popular name for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>, derives from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Christopher Columbus</ENAMEX>; it appears in the name " <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">District of Columbia</ENAMEX>". 
The standard way to refer to a citizen of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>is as an "American". 
Although " <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>" is the official appositional term, "American" and " <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>" are more commonly used to refer to the country adjectivally ("American values", " <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>forces"). 
"American" is rarely used in English to refer to people not connected to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>. 
The phrase " <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>" was originally treated as plural—e.g., "the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>are"—including in the Thirteenth Amendment to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>Constitution, ratified in 1865. 
It became common to treat it as singular—e.g., "the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>is"—after the end of the Civil War. 
The singular form is now standard; the plural form is retained in the idiom "these <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>". 
Geography and environment 
Main articles: Geography of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>, Climate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>, and Environment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>The land area of the contiguous <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>is approximately 1,900 million acres (7,700,000 km2). 
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>, separated from the contiguous <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>, is the largest state at 365 million acres (1,480,000 km2). 
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>, occupying an archipelago in the central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>, southwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>, has just over 4 million acres (16,000 km2). 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>is the world's third or fourth largest nation by total area (land and water), ranking behind <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>and just above or below <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>. 
The ranking varies depending on how two territories disputed by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">India</ENAMEX>are counted and how the total size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>is measured: calculations range from 3,676,486 square miles (9,522,055 km2) to 3,717,813 square miles (9,629,091 km2) to 3,794,101 square miles (9,826,676 km2). 
Including only land area, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>is third in size behind <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, just ahead of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>, with its large size and geographic variety, includes most climate types. 
To the east of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south. 
The southern tip of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX>is tropical, as is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>. 
The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. 
Much of the Western mountains are alpine. 
The climate is arid in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Basin</ENAMEX>, desert in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>in coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, and oceanic in coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oregon</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>and southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>. 
Most of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>is subarctic or polar. 
Extreme weather is not uncommon—the states bordering the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf of Mexico</ENAMEX>are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur within the country, mainly in the Midwest's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tornado Alley</ENAMEX>. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>ecology is considered "megadiverse": about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>, and over 1,800 species of flowering plants are found in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>, few of which occur on the mainland. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>is home to more than 400 mammal, 750 bird, and 500 reptile and amphibian species. 
About 91,000 insect species have been described. 
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 protects threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. 
There are fifty-eight national parks and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas. 
Altogether, the government owns 28.8% of the country's land area. 
Most of this is protected, though some is leased for oil and gas drilling, mining, logging, or cattle ranching; 2.4% is used for military purposes.

Further information: Territorial evolution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>territorial acquisitions 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>is a federal union of fifty states. 
The original thirteen states were the successors of the thirteen colonies that rebelled against British rule. 
Early in the country's history, three new states were organized on territory separated from the claims of the existing states: <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kentucky</ENAMEX>from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tennessee</ENAMEX>from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Carolina</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maine</ENAMEX>from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>. 
Most of the other states have been carved from territories obtained through war or purchase by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>government. 
One set of exceptions comprises <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vermont</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>: each was an independent republic before joining the union. 
During the American Civil War, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Virginia</ENAMEX>broke away from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX>. 
The most recent state— <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>—achieved statehood on August 21, 1959. 
The states do not have the right to secede from the union. 
The states compose the vast bulk of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>land mass; the two other areas considered integral parts of the country are the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">District of Columbia</ENAMEX>, the federal district where the capital, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, is located; and Palmyra Atoll, an uninhabited but incorporated territory in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Ocean</ENAMEX>. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>also possesses five major overseas territories: <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States Virgin Islands</ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>; and American Samoa, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guam</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northern Mariana</ENAMEX>Islands in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>. 
Those born in the major territories (except for American Samoa) possess <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>citizenship. 
American citizens residing in the territories have many of the same rights and responsibilities as citizens residing in the states; however, they are generally exempt from federal income tax, may not vote for president, and have only nonvoting representation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. 
History 
Main article: History of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>Native American and European settlement 
The indigenous peoples of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>mainland, including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>Natives, are believed to have migrated from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, beginning between 12,000 and 40,000 years ago. 
Some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture, developed advanced agriculture, grand architecture, and state-level societies. 
After Europeans began settling <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">the Americas</ENAMEX>, many millions of indigenous Americans died from epidemics of imported diseases such as smallpox. 
The Mayflower transported Pilgrims to the New World in 1620, as depicted in William Halsall's The Mayflower in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Plymouth Harbor</ENAMEX>, 1882. 
In 1492, Genoese explorer <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Christopher Columbus</ENAMEX>, under contract to the Spanish crown, reached several <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>islands, making first contact with the indigenous people. 
On April 2, 1513, Spanish conquistador <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Juan Ponce de</ENAMEX>León landed on what he called " <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">La Florida</ENAMEX>"—the first documented European arrival on what would become the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>mainland. 
Spanish settlements in the region were followed by ones in the present-day southwestern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>that drew thousands through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>. 
French fur traders established outposts of New France around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>eventually claimed much of the North American interior, down to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf of Mexico</ENAMEX>. 
The first successful English settlements were the Virginia Colony in Jamestown in 1607 and the Pilgrims' <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Plymouth Colony</ENAMEX>in 1620. 
The 1628 chartering of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Massachusetts Bay</ENAMEX>Colony resulted in a wave of migration; by 1634, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX>had been settled by some 10,000 Puritans. 
Between the late 1610s and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Revolution</ENAMEX>, about 50,000 convicts were shipped to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s American colonies. 
Beginning in 1614, the Dutch settled along the lower <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hudson River</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Amsterdam</ENAMEX>on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan Island</ENAMEX>. 
In 1674, the Dutch ceded their American territory to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX>; the province of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New</ENAMEX>Netherland was renamed New York. 
Many new immigrants, especially to the South, were indentured servants—some two-thirds of all Virginia immigrants between 1630 and 1680. 
By the turn of the 18th century, African slaves were becoming the primary source of bonded labor. 
With the 1729 division of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Carolinas</ENAMEX>and the 1732 colonization of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Georgia</ENAMEX>, the thirteen British colonies that would become the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States of America</ENAMEX>were established. 
All had local governments with elections open to most free men, with a growing devotion to the ancient rights of Englishmen and a sense of self-government stimulating support for republicanism. 
All legalized the African slave trade. 
With high birth rates, low death rates, and steady immigration, the colonial population grew rapidly. 
The Christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest in both religion and religious liberty. 
In the French and Indian War, British forces seized <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>from the French, but the francophone population remained politically isolated from the southern colonies. 
Excluding the Native Americans (popularly known as "American Indians"), who were being displaced, those thirteen colonies had a population of 2.6 million in 1770, about one-third that of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>; nearly one in five Americans were black slaves. 
Though subject to British taxation, the American colonials had no representation in the Parliament of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Britain</ENAMEX>. 
Independence and expansion 
 
Declaration of Independence, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Trumbull</ENAMEX>, 1817–18 
Tensions between American colonials and the British during the revolutionary period of the 1760s and early 1770s led to the American Revolutionary War, fought from 1775 to 1781. 
On June 14, 1775, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental Congress</ENAMEX>, convening in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>, established a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental Army</ENAMEX>under the command of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George Washington</ENAMEX>. 
Proclaiming that "all men are created equal" and endowed with "certain unalienable Rights", the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>adopted the Declaration of Independence, drafted largely by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Jefferson</ENAMEX>, on July 4, 1776. 
That date is now celebrated annually as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s Independence Day. 
In 1777, the Articles of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Confederation</ENAMEX>established a weak confederal government that operated until 1789. 
After the British defeat by American forces assisted by the French and Spanish, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Britain</ENAMEX>recognized the independence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>and the states' sovereignty over American territory west to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi River</ENAMEX>. 
Those wishing to establish a strong federal government with powers of taxation organized a constitutional convention in 1787. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>Constitution was ratified in 1788, and the new republic's first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Representatives</ENAMEX>, and president— <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George Washington</ENAMEX>—took office in 1789. 
The Bill of Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791. 
Attitudes toward slavery were shifting; a clause in the Constitution protected the transatlantic slave trade only until 1808. 
The Northern states abolished slavery between 1780 and 1804, leaving the slave states of the South as defenders of the "peculiar institution". 
The Second Great Awakening, beginning about 1800, made evangelicalism a force behind various social reform movements, including abolitionism. 
Territorial acquisitions by date 
 
Americans' eagerness to expand westward prompted a long series of Indian Wars. 
The Louisiana Purchase of French-claimed territory under President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Jefferson</ENAMEX>in 1803 almost doubled the nation's size. 
The War of 1812, declared against <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>over various grievances and fought to a draw, strengthened <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>nationalism. 
A series of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>military incursions into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX>led <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>to cede it and other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf Coast</ENAMEX>territory in 1819. 
The Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that stripped the native peoples of their land. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>annexed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>in 1845, amid a period when the concept of Manifest Destiny was becoming popular. 
The 1846 Oregon Treaty with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>led to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>control of the present-day American Northwest. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>victory in the Mexican-American War resulted in the 1848 cession of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>and much of the present-day <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Southwest</ENAMEX>. 
The California Gold Rush of 1848–49 further spurred western migration. 
New railways made relocation easier for settlers and increased conflicts with Native Americans. 
Over a half-century, up to 40 million American bison, or buffalo, were slaughtered for skins and meat and to ease the railways' spread. 
The loss of the buffalo, a primary resource for the plains Indians, was an existential blow to many native cultures. 
Civil War and industrialization 
 
Battle of Gettysburg, lithograph by Currier & Ives, ca. 1863 
Tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over the relationship between the state and federal governments, as well as violent conflicts over the spread of slavery into new states. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abraham Lincoln</ENAMEX>, candidate of the largely antislavery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican Party</ENAMEX>, was elected president in 1860. 
Before he took office, seven slave states declared their secession—which the federal government maintained was illegal—and formed the Confederate States of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>. 
With the Confederate attack upon <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Sumter</ENAMEX>, the Civil War began and four more slave states joined the Confederacy. 
Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 declared slaves in the Confederacy to be free. 
Following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX>victory in 1865, three amendments to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>Constitution ensured freedom for the nearly four million African Americans who had been slaves, made them citizens, and gave them voting rights. 
The war and its resolution led to a substantial increase in federal power. 
The war remains the deadliest conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of 620,000 soldiers. 
Immigrants at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ellis Island</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York Harbor</ENAMEX>, 1902 
After the war, the assassination of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX>radicalized Republican Reconstruction policies aimed at reintegrating and rebuilding the Southern states while ensuring the rights of the newly freed slaves. 
The resolution of the disputed 1876 presidential election by the Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Crow</ENAMEX>laws soon disenfranchised many African Americans. 
In the North, urbanization and an unprecedented influx of immigrants from Southern and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>hastened the country's industrialization. 
The wave of immigration, lasting until 1929, provided labor and transformed American culture. 
National infrastructure development spurred economic growth. 
The 1867 Alaska Purchase from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>completed the country's mainland expansion. 
The Wounded Knee Massacre in 1890 was the last major armed conflict of the Indian Wars. 
In 1893, the indigenous monarchy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Kingdom</ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>was overthrown in a coup led by American residents; the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>annexed the archipelago in 1898. 
Victory in the Spanish–American War the same year demonstrated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>was a world power and led to the annexation of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guam</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philippines</ENAMEX>. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philippines</ENAMEX>gained independence a half-century later; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guam</ENAMEX>remain <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>territories. 
World War I, Great Depression, and World War II

On December 7, 1941, the Empire of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>launched a surprise attack on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pearl Harbor</ENAMEX>, prompting the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>to join the Allies against the Axis powers as well as the internment of Japanese Americans by the thousands. 
Participation in the war spurred capital investment and industrial capacity. 
Among the major combatants, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>was the only nation to become richer—indeed, far richer—instead of poorer because of the war. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied</ENAMEX>conferences at Bretton Woods and Yalta outlined a new system of international organizations that placed the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>at the center of world affairs. 
As victory was won in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, a 1945 international conference held in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>produced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations Charter</ENAMEX>, which became active after the war.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>jockeyed for power after World War II during the Cold War, dominating the military affairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>and the Warsaw Pact, respectively. 
While they engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict. 
Resisting leftist land and income redistribution projects around the world, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>often supported authoritarian governments. 
American troops fought Communist Chinese forces in the Korean War of 1950–53. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Un-American Activities Committee</ENAMEX>pursued a series of investigations into suspected leftist subversion, while Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph McCarthy</ENAMEX>became the figurehead of anticommunist sentiment. 
The 1961 Soviet launch of the first manned spaceflight prompted President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John F. Kennedy</ENAMEX>'s call for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>to be first to land "a man on the moon", achieved in 1969. 
Kennedy also faced a tense nuclear showdown with Soviet forces in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX>. 
Meanwhile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>experienced sustained economic expansion. 
A growing civil rights movement, symbolized and led by African Americans such as Rosa Parks and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Luther King</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jr.</ENAMEX>, used nonviolence to confront segregation and discrimination. 
Following Kennedy's assassination in 1963, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 were passed under President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyndon B. Johnson</ENAMEX>. 
He also signed into law the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>and his successor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX>, expanded a proxy war in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX>into the unsuccessful <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vietnam</ENAMEX>War. 
A widespread countercultural movement grew, fueled by opposition to the war, black nationalism, and the sexual revolution. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betty Friedan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gloria Steinem</ENAMEX>, and others led a new wave of feminism that sought political, social, and economic equality for women. 
As a result of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Watergate</ENAMEX>scandal, in 1974 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nixon</ENAMEX>became the first <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>president to resign, to avoid being impeached on charges including obstruction of justice and abuse of power. 
The Jimmy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX>administration of the late 1970s was marked by stagflation and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX>hostage crisis.

His second term in office brought both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iran-Contra</ENAMEX>scandal and significant diplomatic progress with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>. 
The subsequent Soviet collapse ended the Cold War. 
Contemporary era 
 
The World Trade Center on the morning of September 11, 2001 
Under President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George H. W. Bush</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>took a lead role in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN</ENAMEX>–sanctioned Gulf War. 
The longest economic expansion in modern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>history—from March 1991 to March 2001—encompassed the Bill <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>administration and the dot-com bubble. 
A civil lawsuit and sex scandal led to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s impeachment in 1998, but he remained in office. 
The 2000 presidential election, one of the closest in American history, was resolved by a U.S. Supreme Court decision—George W. Bush, son of George H. W. Bush, became president. 

On September 11, 2001, al-Qaeda terrorists struck the World Trade Center in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX>and The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington, D.C.</ENAMEX>, killing nearly three thousand people. 
In response, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>administration launched the global War on Terror, invading <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>and removing the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>government and al-Qaeda training camps. 
Taliban insurgents continue to fight a guerrilla war. 
In 2002, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>administration began to press for regime change in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX>on controversial grounds. 
Forces of a so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coalition</ENAMEX>of the Willing invaded <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX>in 2003, ousting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX>. 
In 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused severe destruction along much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf Coast</ENAMEX>, devastating <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Orleans</ENAMEX>. 
In 2008, amid a global economic recession, the first African American president, Barack Obama, was elected. 
Major health care and financial system reforms were enacted two years later. 
In 2011, a raid by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>SEALs in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pakistan</ENAMEX>killed al-Qaeda leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osama</ENAMEX>bin Laden. 
The Iraq War ended with the pullout of the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>troops from the country. 
Government, elections, and politics

It is a constitutional republic and representative democracy, "in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law". 
The government is regulated by a system of checks and balances defined by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>Constitution, which serves as the country's supreme legal document. 
In the American federalist system, citizens are usually subject to three levels of government, federal, state, and local; the local government's duties are commonly split between county and municipal governments. 
In almost all cases, executive and legislative officials are elected by a plurality vote of citizens by district. 
There is no proportional representation at the federal level, and it is very rare at lower levels. 
The south façade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, home and workplace of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>president 
The federal government is composed of three branches: 
Legislative: The bicameral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, made up of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Representatives</ENAMEX>, makes federal law, declares war, approves treaties, has the power of the purse, and has the power of impeachment, by which it can remove sitting members of the government. 
Executive: The president is the commander-in-chief of the military, can veto legislative bills before they become law, and appoints the members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabinet</ENAMEX>(subject to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>approval) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies. 
Judicial: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>and lower federal courts, whose judges are appointed by the president with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>approval, interpret laws and overturn those they find unconstitutional. 
The west front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>Building 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Representatives</ENAMEX>has 435 voting members, each representing a congressional district for a two-year term. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>seats are apportioned among the states by population every tenth year. 
As of the 2000 census, seven states have the minimum of one representative, while <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, the most populous state, has fifty-three. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>has 100 members with each state having two senators, elected at-large to six-year terms; one third of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>seats are up for election every other year. 
The president serves a four-year term and may be elected to the office no more than twice. 
The president is not elected by direct vote, but by an indirect electoral college system in which the determining votes are apportioned to the states and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">District of Columbia</ENAMEX>. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>, led by the Chief Justice of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>, has nine members, who serve for life. 
The state governments are structured in roughly similar fashion; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nebraska</ENAMEX>uniquely has a unicameral legislature. 
The governor (chief executive) of each state is directly elected. 
Some state judges and cabinet officers are appointed by the governors of the respective states, while others are elected by popular vote. 
The original text of the Constitution establishes the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states. 
Article One protects the right to the "great writ" of habeas corpus, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Article Three</ENAMEX>guarantees the right to a jury trial in all criminal cases. 
Amendments to the Constitution require the approval of three-fourths of the states. 
The Constitution has been amended twenty-seven times; the first ten amendments, which make up the Bill of Rights, and the Fourteenth Amendment form the central basis of Americans' individual rights. 
All laws and governmental procedures are subject to judicial review and any law ruled in violation of the Constitution is voided. 
The principle of judicial review, not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, was declared by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>in Marbury v. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Madison</ENAMEX>(1803). 
Parties and ideology

The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>has operated under a two-party system for most of its history. 
For elective offices at most levels, state-administered primary elections choose the major party nominees for subsequent general elections. 
Since the general election of 1856, the major parties have been the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Democratic Party</ENAMEX>, founded in 1824, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican Party</ENAMEX>, founded in 1854. 
Since the Civil War, only one third-party presidential candidate—former president <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodore Roosevelt</ENAMEX>, running as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Progressive</ENAMEX>in 1912—has won as much as 20% of the popular vote. 
Within American political culture, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican Party</ENAMEX>is considered center-right or conservative and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Democratic Party</ENAMEX>is considered center-left or liberal. 
The states of the Northeast and West Coast and some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX>states, known as "blue states", are relatively liberal. 
The "red states" of the South and parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Plains</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rocky Mountains</ENAMEX>are relatively conservative. 
The winner of the 2008 presidential election, Democrat Barack Obama, is the 44th U.S. president. 
The 2010 midterm elections saw the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican Party</ENAMEX>take control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>and make gains in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>, where the Democrats retain the majority. 
In the 112th <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>comprises 51 Democrats, two independents who caucus with the Democrats, and 47 Republicans; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>comprises 242 Republicans and 192 Democrats—one seat is vacant. 
There are 29 Republican and 20 Democratic state governors, as well as one independent.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>exercises global economic, political, and military influence. 
It is a permanent member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations Security Council</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX>hosts the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations Headquarters</ENAMEX>. 
It is a member of the G8, G20, and Organisation for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economic Co-</ENAMEX>operation and Development. 
Almost all countries have embassies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington, D.C.</ENAMEX>, and many have consulates around the country. 
Likewise, nearly all nations host American diplomatic missions. 
However, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Korea</ENAMEX>, Bhutan, and the Republic of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>( <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>) do not have formal diplomatic relations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>has a "special relationship" with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>and strong ties with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Zealand</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philippines</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX>, and several European countries. 
It works closely with fellow NATO members on military and security issues and with its neighbors through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization of American States</ENAMEX>and free trade agreements such as the trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>. 
In 2008, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>spent a net $25.4 billion on official development assistance, the most in the world. 
As a share of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s large gross national income (GNI), however, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>contribution of 0.18% ranked last among twenty-two donor states. 
By contrast, private overseas giving by Americans is relatively generous.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX>is run by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Homeland Security</ENAMEX>in peacetime and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of the Navy</ENAMEX>in time of war. 
In 2008, the armed forces had 1.4 million personnel on active duty. 
The Reserves and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Guard</ENAMEX>brought the total number of troops to 2.3 million. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX>also employed about 700,000 civilians, not including contractors. 
Military service is voluntary, though conscription may occur in wartime through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Selective Service System</ENAMEX>. 
American forces can be rapidly deployed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>'s large fleet of transport aircraft, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>'s eleven active aircraft carriers, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Expeditionary Units</ENAMEX>at sea with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>'s Atlantic and Pacific fleets. 
The military operates 865 bases and facilities abroad, and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries. 
The extent of this global military presence has prompted some scholars to describe the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>as maintaining an "empire of bases". 
Total <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>military spending in 2008, more than $600 billion, was over 41% of global military spending and greater than the next fourteen largest national military expenditures combined. 
The per capita spending of $1,967 was about nine times the world average; at 4% of GDP, the rate was the second-highest among the top fifteen military spenders, after <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>. 
The proposed base <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX>budget for 2012, $553 billion, is a 4.2% increase over 2011; an additional $118 billion is proposed for the military campaigns in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. 
Approximately 100,000 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>troops were serving in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>as of November 2011; the withdrawal of the 24,000 American troops remaining in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX>is scheduled to be complete by the end of the year. 
As of November 19, 2011, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>had suffered 4,484 military fatalities during the Iraq War, and 1,841 during the War in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>.

In 2009, the private sector was estimated to constitute 86.4% of the economy, with federal government activity accounting for 4.3% and state and local government activity (including federal transfers) the remaining 9.3%. 
While its economy has reached a postindustrial level of development and its service sector constitutes 67.8% of GDP, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>remains an industrial power. 
The leading business field by gross business receipts is wholesale and retail trade; by net income it is manufacturing. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical</ENAMEX>products are the leading manufacturing field. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>is the third largest producer of oil in the world, as well as its largest importer. 
It is the world's number one producer of electrical and nuclear energy, as well as liquid natural gas, sulfur, phosphates, and salt. 
While agriculture accounts for just under 1% of GDP, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>is the world's top producer of corn and soybeans. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX>are the two most recognized brands in the world.

Compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>property and corporate income tax rates are generally higher, while labor and, particularly, consumption tax rates are lower. 
Income and human development 
Main article: Income in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>See also: Income inequality in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>, Poverty in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>, and Affluence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census Bureau</ENAMEX>, the pretax median household income in 2010 was $49,445. 
The median ranged from $64,308 among Asian American households to $32,068 among African American households. 
Using purchasing power parity exchange rates, the overall median is similar to the most affluent cluster of developed nations. 
After declining sharply during the middle of the 20th century, poverty rates have plateaued since the early 1970s, with 11–15% of Americans below the poverty line every year, and 58.5% spending at least one year in poverty between the ages of 25 and 75. 
In 2010, 46.2 million Americans lived in poverty, a figure that rose for the fourth year in a row. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>welfare state is one of the least extensive in the developed world, reducing both relative poverty and absolute poverty by considerably less than the mean for rich nations, though combined private and public social expenditures per capita are relatively high. 
While the American welfare state effectively reduces poverty among the elderly, it provides relatively little assistance to the young. 
A 2007 UNICEF study of children's well-being in twenty-one industrialized nations ranked the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>next to last. 
Between 1947 and 1979, real median income rose by over 80% for all classes, with the incomes of poor Americans rising faster than those of the rich. 
However, income gains since then have been slower, less widely shared, and accompanied by increased economic insecurity. 
Median household income has increased for all classes since 1980, largely owing to more dual-earner households, the closing of the gender gap, and longer work hours, but the growth has been strongly tilted toward the very top. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Consequently</ENAMEX>, the share of income of the top 1%—21.8% of total reported income in 2005—has more than doubled since 1980, leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>with the greatest income inequality among developed nations. 
The top 1% pays 27.6% of all federal taxes, while the top 10% pays 54.7%. 
Wealth, like income, is highly concentrated: The richest 10% of the adult population possesses 69.8% of the country's household wealth, the second-highest share among developed nations. 
The top 1% possesses 33.4% of net wealth. 
In 2010 the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations Development Programme</ENAMEX>ranked the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>12th among 139 countries on its inequality-adjusted human development index (IHDI), eight places lower than in the standard HDI.

In 2005, 46.6 million Americans, 15.9% of the population, were uninsured, 5.4 million more than in 2001. 
The main cause of this rise is the drop in the number of Americans with employer-sponsored health insurance. 
The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans is a major political issue. 
A 2009 study estimated that lack of insurance is associated with nearly 45,000 deaths a year.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>has the highest documented incarceration rate and total prison population in the world. 
At the start of 2008, more than 2.3 million people were incarcerated, more than one in every 100 adults. 
The current rate is about seven times the 1980 figure, and over three times the figure in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>, the Organisation for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economic Co-</ENAMEX>operation and Development ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OECD</ENAMEX>) country with the next highest rate. 
African American males are jailed at about six times the rate of white males and three times the rate of Hispanic males. 
The country's high rate of incarceration is largely due to sentencing and drug policies. 
Though it has been abolished in most Western nations, capital punishment is sanctioned in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>for certain federal and military crimes, and in thirty-four states. 
Since 1976, when the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty after a four-year moratorium, there have been more than 1,000 executions.

The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the country's population now to be 312,837,000, including an estimated 11.2 million illegal immigrants. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>population almost quadrupled during the 20th century, from about 76 million in 1900. 
The third most populous nation in the world, after <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">India</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>is the only industrialized nation in which large population increases are projected. 
Even with a birth rate of 13.82 per 1,000, 30% below the world average, its population growth rate is positive at 1%, significantly higher than those of many developed nations. 
In fiscal year 2010, over 1 million immigrants (most of whom entered through family reunification) were granted legal residence. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>has been the leading source of new residents for over two decades; since 1998, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">India</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philippines</ENAMEX>have been in the top four sending countries every year. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>has a very diverse population—thirty-one ancestry groups have more than one million members. 
White Americans are the largest racial group; German Americans, Irish Americans, and English Americans constitute three of the country's four largest ancestry groups. 
African Americans are the nation's largest racial minority and third largest ancestry group. 
Asian Americans are the country's second largest racial minority; the two largest Asian American ethnic groups are Chinese Americans and Filipino Americans. 
In 2010, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>population included an estimated 5.2 million people with some American Indian or Alaska Native ancestry (2.9 million exclusively of such ancestry) and 1.2 million with some native Hawaiian or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>island ancestry (0.5 million exclusively). 
The census counted more than 19 million people of "Some Other Race" who were "unable to identify with any" of its five official race categories in 2010. 
The population growth of Hispanic and Latino Americans (the terms are officially interchangeable) is a major demographic trend. 
The 50.5 million Americans of Hispanic descent are identified as sharing a distinct "ethnicity" by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census Bureau</ENAMEX>; 64% of Hispanic Americans are of Mexican descent. 
Between 2000 and 2010, the country's Hispanic population increased 43% while the non-Hispanic population rose just 4.9%. 
Much of this growth is from immigration; as of 2007, 12.6% of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>population was foreign-born, with 54% of that figure born in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>. 
Fertility is also a factor; the average Hispanic woman gives birth to 3.0 children in her lifetime, compared to 2.2 for non-Hispanic black women and 1.8 for non-Hispanic white women (below the replacement rate of 2.1). 
Minorities (as defined by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census Bureau</ENAMEX>as all those beside non-Hispanic, non-multiracial whites) constitute 36.3% of the population in 2010, and nearly 50% of children under age 1, and are projected to constitute the majority by 2042. 
About 82% of Americans live in urban areas (including suburbs); about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000. 
In 2008, 273 incorporated places had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than 1 million residents, and four global cities had over 2 million ( <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>). 
There are fifty-two metropolitan areas with populations greater than 1 million.

English is the de facto national language. 
Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>naturalization requirements—standardize English. 
In 2007, about 226 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. 
Spanish, spoken by 12% of the population at home, is the second most common language and the most widely taught second language. 
Some Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is in at least twenty-eight states. 
Both Hawaiian and English are official languages in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>by state law. 
While neither has an official language, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Mexico</ENAMEX>has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French. 
Other states, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, mandate the publication of Spanish versions of certain government documents including court forms. 
Many jurisdictions with large numbers of non-English speakers produce government materials, especially voting information, in the most commonly spoken languages in those jurisdictions. 
Several insular territories grant official recognition to their native languages, along with English: Samoan and Chamorro are recognized by American Samoa and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guam</ENAMEX>, respectively; Carolinian and Chamorro are recognized by the Northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mariana Islands</ENAMEX>; Spanish is an official language of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>. 
Religion

In a 2002 study, 59% of Americans said that religion played a "very important role in their lives", a far higher figure than that of any other wealthy nation. 
According to a 2007 survey, 78.4% of adults identified themselves as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christian</ENAMEX>, down from 86.4% in 1990. 
Protestant denominations accounted for 51.3%, while Roman Catholicism, at 23.9%, was the largest individual denomination. 
The study categorizes white evangelicals, 26.3% of the population, as the country's largest religious cohort; another study estimates evangelicals of all races at 30–35%. 
The total reporting non-Christian religions in 2007 was 4.7%, up from 3.3% in 1990. 
The leading non-Christian faiths were Judaism (1.7%), Buddhism (0.7%), Islam (0.6%), Hinduism (0.4%), and Unitarian Universalism (0.3%). 
The survey also reported that 16.1% of Americans described themselves as agnostic, atheist, or simply having no religion, up from 8.2% in 1990. 
Family structure 
 
In 2007, 58% of Americans age 18 and over were married, 6% were widowed, 10% were divorced, and 25% had never been married. 
Women now mostly work outside the home and receive a majority of bachelor's degrees. 
Same-sex marriage is a contentious issue. 
Some states permit civil unions or domestic partnerships in lieu of marriage. 
Since 2003, several states have legalized gay marriage as the result of judicial or legislative action. 
Meanwhile, the federal government and a majority of states define marriage as between a man and a woman and/or explicitly prohibit same-sex marriage. 
Public opinion on the issue has shifted from general opposition in the 1990s to a statistical deadlock as of 2011. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>teenage pregnancy rate, 79.8 per 1,000 women, is the highest among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OECD</ENAMEX>nations. 
Abortion policy was left to the states until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>legalized the practice in 1973. 
The issue remains highly controversial, with public opinion closely divided for many years. 
Many states ban public funding of the procedure and restrict late-term abortions, require parental notification for minors, and mandate a waiting period. 
While the abortion rate is falling, the abortion ratio of 241 per 1,000 live births and abortion rate of 15 per 1,000 women aged 15–44 remain higher than those of most Western nations. 
Culture 
Main article: Culture of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>See also: Social class in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>The Statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Liberty</ENAMEX>is a globally recognized symbol of both the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>and ideals such as freedom, democracy, and opportunity. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>is a multicultural nation, home to a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values. 
Aside from the now small Native American and Native Hawaiian populations, nearly all Americans or their ancestors immigrated within the past five centuries. 
Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>. 
More recent immigration from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>and especially <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>has added to a cultural mix that has been described as both a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics. 
American culture is considered the most individualistic in the world. 
Though the American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants, other developed nations offer greater social mobility. 
While the mainstream culture holds that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>is a classless society, scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values. 
The American middle and professional class has initiated many contemporary social trends such as modern feminism, environmentalism, and multiculturalism. 
Americans' self-images, social viewpoints, and cultural expectations are associated with their occupations to an unusually close degree. 
While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic achievement, being ordinary or average is generally seen as a positive attribute.
