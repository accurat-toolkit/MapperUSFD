European Union 
 
The European Union (EU) i/ˌjʊərəˈpiːənˈjuːnjən/ is an economic and political union of 27 member states which are located primarily in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. 
The EU traces its origins from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Coal and Steel Community</ENAMEX>( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECSC</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Economic Community</ENAMEX>( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEC</ENAMEX>), formed by six countries in 1958. 
In the intervening years the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>has grown in size by the accession of new member states, and in power by the addition of policy areas to its remit. 
The Maastricht Treaty established the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>under its current name in 1993. 
The latest amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU, the Treaty of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lisbon</ENAMEX>, came into force in 2009. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>operates through a hybrid system of supranational independent institutions and intergovernmentally made decisions negotiated by the member states. 
Important institutions of the EU include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Commission</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Council</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court of Justice</ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Central Bank</ENAMEX>. 
The European Parliament is elected every five years by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>citizens. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>has developed a single market through a standardised system of laws which apply in all member states. 
Within the Schengen Area (which includes EU and non-EU states) passport controls have been abolished. 
EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries and regional development. 
A monetary union, the eurozone, was established in 1999 and is currently composed of 17 member states. 
Through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Common Foreign</ENAMEX>and Security Policy the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>has developed a limited role in external relations and defence. 
Permanent diplomatic missions have been established around the world and the EU is represented at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX>, the WTO, the G8 and the G-20. 
With a combined population of over 500 million inhabitants, or 7.3% of the world population, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>generated a nominal GDP of 16,242 billion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>dollars in 2010, which represents an estimated 20% of global GDP when measured in terms of purchasing power parity.

History 
Main article: History of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Schuman</ENAMEX>proposing the Coal and Steel Community on 9 May 1950. 
After World War II, moves towards European integration were seen by many as an escape from the extreme forms of nationalism which had devastated the continent. 
One such attempt to unite Europeans was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Coal and Steel Community</ENAMEX>, which was declared to be "a first step in the federation of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe"</ENAMEX>, starting with the aim of eliminating the possibility of further wars between its member states by means of pooling the national heavy industries. 
The founding members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Community</ENAMEX>were <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belgium</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>, Luxembourg, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">the Netherlands</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>. 
The originators and supporters of the Community include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Monnet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Schuman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Henri Spaak</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alcide De Gasperi</ENAMEX>. 
In 1957, the six countries signed the Treaties of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rome</ENAMEX>, which extended the earlier cooperation within the European Coal and Steel Community ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECSC</ENAMEX>) and created the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Economic Community</ENAMEX>, ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEC</ENAMEX>) establishing a customs union and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Atomic Energy Community</ENAMEX>( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euratom</ENAMEX>) for cooperation in developing nuclear energy. 
The treaty came into force in 1958. 
The Rome Treaty was signed in 1957 and came into force in 1958. 
It created the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Economic Community</ENAMEX>. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEC</ENAMEX>and Euratom were created separately from ECSC, although they shared the same courts and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Common Assembly</ENAMEX>. 
The executives of the new communities were called Commissions, as opposed to the " <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">High Authority</ENAMEX>". 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEC</ENAMEX>was headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Hallstein</ENAMEX>( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hallstein Commission</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Euratom</ENAMEX>was headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Armand</ENAMEX>( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armand Commission</ENAMEX>) and then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Etienne Hirsch</ENAMEX>. 
Euratom would integrate sectors in nuclear energy while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEC</ENAMEX>would develop a customs union between members. 
Throughout the 1960s tensions began to show with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>seeking to limit supranational power. 
However, in 1965 an agreement was reached and hence in 1967 the Merger Treaty was signed in Brussels. 
It came into force on 1 July 1967 and created a single set of institutions for the three communities, which were collectively referred to as the European Communities (EC), although commonly just as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Rey</ENAMEX>presided over the first merged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>(Rey Commission). 
The Iron Curtain's fall in 1989 enabled eastward enlargement. 
(Berlin Wall) 
In 1973 the Communities enlarged to include Denmark (including Greenland, which later left the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Community</ENAMEX>in 1985), <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ireland</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>. 
Norway had negotiated to join at the same time but Norwegian voters rejected membership in a referendum and so Norway remained outside. 
In 1979, the first direct, democratic elections to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Parliament</ENAMEX>were held. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greece</ENAMEX>joined in 1981, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Portugal</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>in 1986. 
In 1985, the Schengen Agreement led the way toward the creation of open borders without passport controls between most member states and some non-member states. 
In 1986, the European flag began to be used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Community</ENAMEX>and the Single European Act was signed. 
In 1990, after the fall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iron Curtain</ENAMEX>, the former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX>became part of the Community as part of a newly united <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>. 
With enlargement towards European formerly communist countries as well as Cyprus (Greek part) and Malta on the agenda, the Copenhagen criteria for candidate members to join the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>were agreed. 
The introduction of the euro in 2002 replaced several national currencies. 
The European Union was formally established when the Maastricht Treaty came into force on 1 November 1993, and in 1995 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Finland</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sweden</ENAMEX>joined the newly established EU. 
In 2002, euro notes and coins replaced national currencies in 12 of the member states. 
Since then, the eurozone has increased to encompass 17 countries. 
In 2004, the EU saw its biggest enlargement to date when Cyprus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Czech Republic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Estonia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lithuania</ENAMEX>, Malta, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>, Slovakia and Slovenia joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX>. 
On 1 January 2007, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Romania</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bulgaria</ENAMEX>became the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>'s newest members. 
In the same year Slovenia adopted the euro, followed in 2008 by Cyprus and Malta, by Slovakia in 2009 and by Estonia in 2011. 
In June 2009, the 2009 Parliament elections were held leading to a renewal of Barroso's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>Presidency, and in July 2009 Iceland formally applied for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>membership. 
On 1 December 2009, the Lisbon Treaty entered into force and reformed many aspects of the EU. 
In particular it changed the legal structure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>, merging the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>three pillars system into a single legal entity provisioned with legal personality, and it created a permanent President of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Council</ENAMEX>, the first of which is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herman Van Rompuy</ENAMEX>, and a strengthened High Representative, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine Ashton</ENAMEX>. 
On 9 December 2011, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Croatia</ENAMEX>signed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>accession treaty. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>accession referendum is to be held in that country on 22 January 2012. 
If the vote is yes, the country's entry into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>will make it the 28th member state.

Geography 
Main article: Geography of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>The EU's climate is influenced by its 65,993 km (41,006 mi) coastline (Cyprus). 
Mont Blanc in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX>is the highest peak in the EU. 
The EU's member states cover an area of 4,423,147 square kilometres (1,707,787 sq mi). 
The EU is larger in area than all but six countries, and its highest peak is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mont</ENAMEX>Blanc in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Graian Alps</ENAMEX>, 4,810.45 metres (15,782 ft) above sea level. 
The lowest point in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>is Zuidplaspolder in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">the Netherlands</ENAMEX>, at 7 m (23 ft) below sea level. 
The landscape, climate, and economy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>are influenced by its coastline, which is 65,993 kilometres (41,006 mi) long. 
The EU has the world's second-longest coastline, after <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>. 
The combined member states share land borders with 19 non-member states for a total of 12,441 kilometres (7,730 mi), the fifth-longest border in the world. 
Including the overseas territories of member states, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>experiences most types of climate from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arctic</ENAMEX>( <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North</ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Europe</ENAMEX>) to tropical (French Guyana), rendering meteorological averages for the EU as a whole meaningless. 
The majority of the people lives in areas with a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>climate ( <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern Europe</ENAMEX>), a temperate maritime climate (North- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX>), or a warm summer continental or hemiboreal climate (Central and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>). 
The EU's population is highly urbanised, with some 75% of inhabitants (and growing, projected to be 90% in 7 states by 2020) living in urban areas. 
Cities are largely spread out across the EU, although with a large grouping in and around the Benelux. 
An increasing percentage of this is due to low density urban sprawl which is extending into natural areas. 
In some cases this urban growth has been due to the influx of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>funds into a region. 
Member states 
Main article: Member State of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>See also: Special Member State territories and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>, Enlargement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>, Future enlargement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>, and Withdrawal from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>The member states of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>(European Communities pre-1993), animated in order of accession. 
Only territories in and around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>are shown. 
The European Union is composed of 27 sovereign Member States: <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belgium</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bulgaria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cyprus</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Czech Republic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denmark</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Estonia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Finland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greece</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ireland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lithuania</ENAMEX>, Luxembourg, Malta, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">the Netherlands</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Portugal</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Romania</ENAMEX>, Slovakia, Slovenia, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sweden</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>. 
The Union's membership has grown from the original six founding states— <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belgium</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, (then-West) <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>, Luxembourg and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">the Netherlands</ENAMEX>—to the present day 27 by successive enlargements as countries acceded to the treaties and by doing so, pooled their sovereignty in exchange for representation in the institutions. 
To join the EU a country must meet the Copenhagen criteria, defined at the 1993 Copenhagen European <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>. 
These require a stable democracy that respects human rights and the rule of law; a functioning market economy capable of competition within the EU; and the acceptance of the obligations of membership, including EU law. 
Evaluation of a country's fulfilment of the criteria is the responsibility of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Council</ENAMEX>. 
No member state has ever left the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX>, although Greenland (an autonomous province of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denmark</ENAMEX>) withdrew in 1985. 
The Lisbon Treaty now provides a clause dealing with how a member leaves the EU. 
Croatia is an acceding country and may become the 28th member of the EU on 1 July 2013, subject to a national referendum. 
There are four candidate countries: Iceland, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Macedonia</ENAMEX>, Montenegro and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Turkey</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Albania</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bosnia</ENAMEX>and Herzegovina and Serbia are officially recognised as potential candidates. 
Kosovo is also listed as a potential candidate but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Commission</ENAMEX>does not list it as an independent country because not all member states recognise it as an independent country separate from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Serbia</ENAMEX>. 
Four countries forming the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EFTA</ENAMEX>(that are not EU members) have partly committed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>'s economy and regulations: Iceland (a candidate country for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>membership), Liechtenstein and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Norway</ENAMEX>, which are a part of the single market through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Economic Area</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX>, which has similar ties through bilateral treaties. 
The relationships of the European microstates, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Andorra</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Monaco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Marino</ENAMEX>and the Vatican include the use of the euro and other areas of cooperation. 
Environment

The first environmental policy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX>was launched in 1972. 
Since then it has addressed issues such as acid rain, the thinning of the ozone layer, air quality, noise pollution, waste and water pollution. 
The Water Framework Directive is an example of a water policy, aiming for rivers, lakes, ground and coastal waters to be of "good quality" by 2015. 
The Birds Directive and the Habitats Directive are pieces of European Union legislation for protection of biodiversity and natural habitats. 
These protections however only directly cover animals and plants; fungi and micro-organisms have no protection under European Union law. 
The directives are implemented through the Natura 2000 programme and covers 30,000 sites throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. 
In 2007, the Polish government sought to build a motorway through the Rospuda valley, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>has been blocking construction as the valley is a wildlife area covered by the programme. 
In 2007, member states agreed that the EU is to use 20% renewable energy in the future and that it has to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in 2020 by at least 20% compared to 1990 levels. 
This includes measures that in 2020, 10% of the overall fuel quantity used by cars and trucks in EU 27 should be running on renewable energy such as biofuels. 
This is considered to be one of the most ambitious moves of an important industrialised region to fight global warming.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>operates solely within those competencies conferred on it upon the treaties and according to the principle of subsidiarity (which dictates that action by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>should only be taken where an objective cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states alone). 
Laws made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>institutions are passed in a variety of forms. 
Generally speaking they can be classified into two groups: those which come into force without the necessity for national implementation measures, and those which specifically require national implementation measures. 
Governance 
Main articles: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>institutions and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legislature</ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European</ENAMEX>Union 
 
The European Union has seven institutions: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Parliament</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Commission</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Council</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Central Bank</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court of Justice</ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Court</ENAMEX>of Auditors. 
Competencies in scrutinising and amending legislation are divided between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Parliament</ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>while executive tasks are carried out by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Commission</ENAMEX>and in a limited capacity by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Council</ENAMEX>(not to be confused with the aforementioned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>). 
The monetary policy of the eurozone is governed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Central Bank</ENAMEX>. 
The interpretation and the application of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>law and the treaties are ensured by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court of Justice</ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>. 
There are also a number of ancillary bodies which advise the EU or operate in a specific area. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Council</ENAMEX>President of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Council</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herman Van Rompuy</ENAMEX>The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Council</ENAMEX>gives direction to the EU, and convenes at least four times a year. 
It comprises the President of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Council</ENAMEX>, the President of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Commission</ENAMEX>and one representative per member state; either its head of state or head of government. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Council</ENAMEX>has been described by some as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX>'s "supreme political authority". 
It is actively involved in the negotiation of the treaty changes and defines the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>'s policy agenda and strategies. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Council</ENAMEX>uses its leadership role to sort out disputes between member states and the institutions, and to resolve political crises and disagreements over controversial issues and policies. 
It acts externally as a "collective Head of State" and ratifies important documents (for example, international agreements and treaties). 
On 19 November 2009, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herman Van Rompuy</ENAMEX>was chosen as the first permanent President of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Council</ENAMEX>. 
On 1 December 2009, the Treaty of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lisbon</ENAMEX>entered into force and he assumed office. 
Ensuring the external representation of the EU, driving consensus and settling divergences among members are tasks for the President both during the convocations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Council</ENAMEX>and in the time periods between them. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Council</ENAMEX>should not be mistaken for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council of Europe</ENAMEX>, an international organisation independent from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU. 
 
Commission 
 
Commission</ENAMEX>President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">José Manuel Barroso</ENAMEX>The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Commission</ENAMEX>acts as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>'s executive arm and is responsible for initiating legislation and the day-to-day running of the EU. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>is also seen as the motor of European integration. 
It operates as a cabinet government, with 27 Commissioners for different areas of policy, one from each member state, though Commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home state. 
One of the 27 is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>President (currently <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">José Manuel Durão Barroso</ENAMEX>) appointed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Council</ENAMEX>. 
After the President, the most prominent Commissioner is the High Representative of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union for Foreign Affairs</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Policy</ENAMEX>who is ex-officio Vice President of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>and is chosen by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Council</ENAMEX>too. 
The other 25 Commissioners are subsequently appointed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>in agreement with the nominated President. 
Eventually, the 27 Commissioners as a single body are subject to a vote of approval by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Parliament</ENAMEX>. 
Parliament 
 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Parliament</ENAMEX>building in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strasbourg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>The European Parliament ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EP</ENAMEX>) forms one half of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>'s legislature (the other half is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>, see below). 
The 736 (soon to be 751) Members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Parliament</ENAMEX>(MEPs) are directly elected by EU citizens every five years on the basis of proportional representation to the share of votes collected by each political party. 
Although MEPs are elected on a national basis, they sit according to political groups rather than their nationality. 
Each country has a set number of seats and is divided into sub-national constituencies where this does not affect the proportional nature of the voting system. 
The ordinary legislative procedure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>. 
The Parliament and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>pass legislation jointly in nearly all areas under the ordinary legislative procedure. 
This also applies to the EU budget. 
Finally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>is accountable to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Parliament</ENAMEX>, requiring its approval to take office, having to report back to it and subject to motions of censure from it. 
The President of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Parliament</ENAMEX>carries out the role of speaker in parliament and represents it externally. 
The EP President and Vice Presidents are elected by MEPs every two and a half years. 
Council 
 
The Council of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>(also called the "Council" and sometimes referred to as the " <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council of Ministers"</ENAMEX>) forms the other half of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>'s legislature. 
It consists of a government minister from each member state and meets in different compositions depending on the policy area being addressed. 
Notwithstanding its different configurations, it is considered to be one single body. 
In addition to its legislative functions, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>also exercises executive functions in relations to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Common Foreign</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Policy</ENAMEX>. 
Budget 
Main article: Budget of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>The 2011 EU budget (€141.9 bn. in total; commitment appropriations): 
Cohesion and competitiveness for growth and employment (45%) 
Citizenship, freedom, security and justice (1%) 
The EU as a global player (6%) 
Rural development (11%) 
Direct aids and market related expenditures (31%) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administration</ENAMEX>(6%) 
 
The 27 member state EU had an agreed budget of €120.7 billion for the year 2007 and €864.3 billion for the period 2007–2013, representing 1.10% and 1.05% of the EU-27's GNI forecast for the respective periods. 
By comparison, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>'s expenditure for 2004 was estimated to be €759 billion, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>was estimated to have spent €801 billion. 
In 1960, the budget of the then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Economic Community</ENAMEX>was 0.03% of GDP. 
In the 2010 budget of €141.5 billion, the largest single expenditure item is "cohesion & competitiveness" with around 45% of the total budget. 
Next comes "agriculture" with approximately 31% of the total. 
"Rural development, environment and fisheries" takes up around 11%. 
"Administration" accounts for around 6%. 
The "EU as a global partner" and "citizenship, freedom, security and justice" bring up the rear with approximately 6% and 1% respectively. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Court of Auditors</ENAMEX>aims to ensure that the budget of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>has been properly accounted for. 
The court provides an audit report for each financial year to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Parliament</ENAMEX>. 
The Parliament uses this to decide whether to approve the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>'s handling of the budget. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court</ENAMEX>also gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court</ENAMEX>of Auditors is legally obliged to provide the Parliament and the Council with "a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions". 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court</ENAMEX>has not given an unqualified approval of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX>'s accounts since 1993. 
In their report on 2009 the auditors found that five areas of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Union</ENAMEX>expenditure, agriculture and the cohesion fund, were materially affected by error. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Commission</ENAMEX>estimated that the financial impact of irregularities was €1,863 million. 
Competences 
 
EU member states retain all powers not explicitly handed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>. 
In some areas the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>enjoys exclusive competence. 
These are areas in which member states have renounced any capacity to enact legislation. 
In other areas the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>and its member states share the competence to legislate. 
While both can legislate, member states can only legislate to the extent to which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>has not. 
In other policy areas the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>can only co-ordinate, support and supplement member state action but cannot enact legislation with the aim of harmonising national laws. 
That a particular policy area falls into a certain category of competence is not necessarily indicative of what legislative procedure is used for enacting legislation within that policy area. 
Different legislative procedures are used within the same category of competence, and even with the same policy area. 
The distribution of competences in various policy areas between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Member States</ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX>is divided in the following three categories: 
As outlined in Part I, Title I of the consolidated Treaty on the Functioning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>: 
Exclusive competence: 
"The Union has exclusive competence to make directives and conclude international agreements when provided for in a Union legislative act." 
the customs union 
the establishing of the competition rules necessary for the functioning of the internal market 
monetary policy for the Member States whose currency is the euro 
the conservation of marine biological resources under the common fisheries policy 
common commercial policy 
Shared competence: 
"Member States cannot exercise competence in areas where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX>has done so."	"Union exercise of competence shall not result in Member States being prevented from exercising theirs in:" 
the internal market 
social policy, for the aspects defined in this Treaty 
economic, social and territorial cohesion 
agriculture and fisheries, excluding the conservation of marine biological resources 
environment 
consumer protection 
transport 
trans-European networks 
energy 
the area of freedom, security and justice 
common safety concerns in public health matters, for the aspects defined in this Treaty 
research, technological development and space 
development cooperation, humanitarian aid 
"The Union coordinates <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Member States</ENAMEX>policies or implements supplemental to theirs common policies, not covered elsewhere" 
coordination of economic, employment and social policies 
common foreign, security and defence policies 
Supporting competence: 
"The Union can carry out actions to support, coordinate or supplement <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Member States</ENAMEX>' actions in:" 
the protection and improvement of human health 
industry 
culture 
tourism 
education, youth, sport and vocational training 
civil protection (disaster prevention) 
administrative cooperation 
 
Legal system 
Further information: EU Law, EU treaties, and Charter of Fundamental Rights of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>The EU is based on a series of treaties. 
These first established the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX>and the EU, and then made amendments to those founding treaties. 
These are power-giving treaties which set broad policy goals and establish institutions with the necessary legal powers to implement those goals. 
These legal powers include the ability to enact legislation which can directly affect all member states and their inhabitants. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>has legal personality, with the right to sign agreements and international treaties. 
Under the principle of supremacy, national courts are required to enforce the treaties that their member states have ratified, and thus the laws enacted under them, even if doing so requires them to ignore conflicting national law, and (within limits) even constitutional provisions. 
Courts of Justice 
 
The judicial branch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>—formally called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court of Justice</ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>—consists of three courts: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court of Justice</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Court</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union Civil Service Tribunal</ENAMEX>. 
Together they interpret and apply the treaties and the law of the EU. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court of Justice</ENAMEX>primarily deals with cases taken by member states, the institutions, and cases referred to it by the courts of member states. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Court</ENAMEX>mainly deals with cases taken by individuals and companies directly before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>'s courts, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union Civil Service Tribunal</ENAMEX>adjudicates in disputes between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>and its civil service. 
Decisions from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Court</ENAMEX>can be appealed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court of Justice</ENAMEX>but only on a point of law. 
Fundamental rights 
 
The last amendment to the constitutional basis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>came into force in 2009 and was the Lisbon Treaty. 
The treaties declare that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>itself is "founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities ... in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail." 
In 2009 the Lisbon Treaty gave legal effect to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>. 
The charter is a codified catalogue of fundamental rights against which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>'s legal acts can be judged. 
It consolidates many rights which were previously recognised by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court of Justice</ENAMEX>and derived from the "constitutional traditions common to the member states." 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court of Justice</ENAMEX>has long recognised fundamental rights and has, on occasion, invalidated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>legislation based on its failure to adhere to those fundamental rights. 
The Charter of Fundamental Rights was drawn up in 2000. 
Although originally not legally binding the Charter was frequently cited by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>'s courts as encapsulating rights which the courts had long recognised as the fundamental principles of EU law. 
Although signing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Convention on Human Rights</ENAMEX>( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECHR</ENAMEX>) is a condition for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>membership, previously, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>itself could not accede to the Convention as it is neither a state nor had the competence to accede. 
The Lisbon Treaty and Protocol 14 to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECHR</ENAMEX>have changed this: the former binds the EU to accede to the Convention while the latter formally permits it. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>also promoted human rights issues in the wider world. 
The EU opposes the death penalty and has proposed its worldwide abolition. 
Abolition of the death penalty is a condition for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>membership. 
Acts 
 
The main legal acts of the EU come in three forms: regulations, directives, and decisions. 
Regulations become law in all member states the moment they come into force, without the requirement for any implementing measures, and automatically override conflicting domestic provisions. 
Directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result. 
The details of how they are to be implemented are left to member states. 
When the time limit for implementing directives passes, they may, under certain conditions, have direct effect in national law against member states. 
Decisions offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation. 
They are legal acts which only apply to specified individuals, companies or a particular member state. 
They are most often used in Competition Law, or on rulings on State Aid, but are also frequently used for procedural or administrative matters within the institutions. 
Regulations, directives, and decisions are of equal legal value and apply without any formal hierarchy. 
Justice and home affairs 
Further information: Area of freedom, security and justice 
 
The Schengen Area comprises most member states ensuring open borders. 
Since the creation of the EU in 1993, it has developed its competencies in the area of justice and home affairs, initially at an intergovernmental level and later by supranationalism. 
To this end, agencies have been established that co-ordinate associated actions: Europol for co-operation of police forces, Eurojust for co-operation between prosecutors, and Frontex for co-operation between border control authorities. 
The EU also operates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schengen Information System</ENAMEX>which provides a common database for police and immigration authorities. 
This cooperation had to particularly be developed with the advent of open borders through the Schengen Agreement and the associated cross border crime. 
Furthermore, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX>has legislated in areas such as extradition, family law, asylum law, and criminal justice. 
Prohibitions against sexual and nationality discrimination have a long standing in the treaties. 
In more recent years, these have been supplemented by powers to legislate against discrimination based on race, religion, disability, age, and sexual orientation. 
By virtue of these powers, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>has enacted legislation on sexual discrimination in the work-place, age discrimination, and racial discrimination. 
Foreign relations 
Main articles: Foreign relations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>, Common Foreign and Security Policy, and European External <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Action Service 
 
High Representative</ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union for Foreign Affairs</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Policy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine Ashton</ENAMEX>. 
Foreign policy cooperation between member states dates from the establishment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Community</ENAMEX>in 1957, when member states negotiated as a bloc in international trade negotiations under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Common Commercial Policy</ENAMEX>. 
Steps for a more wide ranging coordination in foreign relations began in 1970 with the establishment of European Political Cooperation which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies. 
It was not, however, until 1987 when European Political Cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the Single European Act. 
EPC was renamed as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Common Foreign</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Security Policy</ENAMEX>(CFSP) by the Maastricht Treaty. 
The aims of the CFSP are to promote both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>'s own interests and those of the international community as a whole, including the furtherance of international co-operation, respect for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFSP</ENAMEX>requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue. 
The unanimity and difficult issues treated under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFSP</ENAMEX>makes disagreements, such as those which occurred over the war in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX>, not uncommon. 
The EU participates in all G8 and G20 summits. 
(G20 summit in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seoul</ENAMEX>) 
The co-ordinator and representative of the CFSP within the EU is the High Representative of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union for Foreign Affairs</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Policy</ENAMEX>(currently <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine Ashton</ENAMEX>) who speaks on behalf of the EU in foreign policy and defence matters, and has the task of articulating the positions expressed by the member states on these fields of policy into a common alignment. 
The High Representative heads up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European External Action Service</ENAMEX>(EEAS), a unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>department that has been officially implemented and operational since 1 December 2010 on the occasion of the first anniversary of the entry into force of the Treaty of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lisbon</ENAMEX>. 
The EEAS will serve as a foreign ministry and diplomatic corps for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>. 
Besides the emerging international policy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>, the international influence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>is also felt through enlargement. 
The perceived benefits of becoming a member of the EU act as an incentive for both political and economic reform in states wishing to fulfil the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>'s accession criteria, and are considered an important factor contributing to the reform of European formerly Communist countries. 
This influence on the internal affairs of other countries is generally referred to as "soft power", as opposed to military "hard power". 
Military 
Main article: Military of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>The Eurofighter Typhoon and Eurocopter Tiger are built by a consortium of some EU states. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>does not have one unified military. 
The predecessors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>were not devised as a strong military alliance because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>was largely seen as appropriate and sufficient for defence purposes. 
21 EU members are members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>while the remaining member states follow policies of neutrality. 
However the compatibility of their neutrality with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>membership is questioned (including by the Prime Minister of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Finland</ENAMEX>) and with mutual solidarity in the event of disasters, terrorist attacks and armed aggression covered by TEU Article 42 (7) and TFEU Article 222 of the EU treaties; the Western European Union, a military alliance with a mutual defence clause, was disbanded in 2010 as its role had been transferred to the EU. 
According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stockholm</ENAMEX>International <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peace Research Institute</ENAMEX>( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SIPRI</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>spent more than $44 billion on defence in 2010, placing it third in the world after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>spent almost €39 billion, the fourth largest. 
Together, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>account for 45 per cent of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s defence budget, 50 per cent of its military capacity and 70 per cent of all spending in military research and development. 
In 2000, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>accounted for 97% of the total military research budget of the then 15 EU member states. 
Following the Kosovo War in 1999, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Council</ENAMEX>agreed that "the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX>must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and the readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>". 
To that end, a number of efforts were made to increase the EU's military capability, notably the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Helsinki</ENAMEX>Headline Goal process. 
After much discussion, the most concrete result was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU Battlegroups</ENAMEX>initiative, each of which is planned to be able to deploy quickly about 1500 personnel. 
EU forces have been deployed on peacekeeping missions from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>to the former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>. 
EU military operations are supported by a number of bodies, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Defence Agency</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union Satellite Centre</ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union Military Staff</ENAMEX>. 
In an EU consisting of 27 members, substantial security and defence cooperation is increasingly relying on great power cooperation. 
Humanitarian aid 
Further information: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECHO</ENAMEX>( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Commission</ENAMEX>) 
 
Collectively, the EU is the largest contributor of foreign aid in the world. 
The European Commissions Humanitarian Aid Office, or " <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECHO</ENAMEX>", provides humanitarian aid from the EU to developing countries. 
In 2006 its budget amounted to €671 million, 48% of which went to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">African</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>and Pacific countries. 
Counting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>'s own contributions and those of its member states together, the EU is the largest aid donor in the world. 
Humanitarian aid is financed directly by the budget (70%) as part of the financial instruments for external action and also by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Development Fund</ENAMEX>(30%). 
The EU's external action financing is divided into 'geographic' instruments and 'thematic' instruments. 
The 'geographic' instruments provide aid through the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI, €16.9 billion, 2007–2013), which must spend 95% of its budget on overseas development assistance (ODA), and from the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), which contains some relevant programmes. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Development Fund</ENAMEX>( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDF</ENAMEX>, €22.7 bn, 2008–2013) is made up of voluntary contributions by member states, but there is pressure to merge the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDF</ENAMEX>into the budget-financed instruments to encourage increased contributions to match the 0.7% target and allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Parliament</ENAMEX>greater oversight. 
The EU's aid has previously been criticised by the eurosceptic think-tank Open <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>for being inefficient, mis-targeted and linked to economic objectives. 
Furthermore, some charities such as ActionAid have claimed European governments have inflated the amount they have spent on aid by incorrectly including money spent on debt relief, foreign students, and refugees. 
Under the de-inflated figures, the EU as a whole did not reach its internal aid target in 2006 and is expected not to reach the international target of 0.7% of gross national income until 2015. 
However, four countries have reached the 0.7% target: <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sweden</ENAMEX>, Luxembourg, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">the Netherlands</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denmark</ENAMEX>. 
In 2005 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>aid was 0.34% of the GNP which was higher than that of either the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>. 
The previous commissioner for aid, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Michel</ENAMEX>, has called for aid to be delivered more rapidly, to greater effect, and on humanitarian principles. 
Economy 
Main articles: Economy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>and Regional policy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>The ten largest economies in the world counting the EU as a single entity, by GDP (2011) 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>has established a single market across the territory of all its members. 
A monetary union, the eurozone, using a single currency comprises 17 member states. 
In 2010 the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>generated an estimated 26% (16.242 billion international dollars) share of the global gross domestic product making it the largest economy in the world. 
It is the largest exporter, the largest importer of goods and services, and the biggest trading partner to several large countries such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">India</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>. 
Of the top 500 largest corporations measured by revenue (Fortune Global 500 in 2010), 161 have their headquarters in the EU. 
In May 2007 unemployment in the EU stood at 7% while investment was at 21.4% of GDP, inflation at 2.2% and public deficit at −0.9% of GDP. 
There is a significant variance for annual per capita income within individual EU states, these range from €11,000 to €70,000 (about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>$14,000 to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>$90,000). 
The difference between the richest and poorest regions (271 NUTS-2 regions of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) ranged, in 2008, from 28% of the EU27 average in the region of Severozapaden in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bulgaria</ENAMEX>, to 343% of the average in Inner <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>. 
On the high end, Inner <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>has €85,800 PPP per capita, Luxembourg €70,000, and Bruxelles-Cap €54,100, while the poorest regions, are Severozapaden with €7,100 PPP per capita, Nord-Est with €7,200 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPP</ENAMEX>per capita, Severen tsentralen with €7,500 and Yuzhen tsentralen with €7,600. 
Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds are supporting the development of underdeveloped regions of the EU. 
Such regions are primarily located in the new member states of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Europe</ENAMEX>. 
Several funds provide emergency aid, support for candidate members to transform their country to conform to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>'s standard (Phare, ISPA, and SAPARD), and support to the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USSR Commonwealth of Independent States</ENAMEX>(TACIS). 
TACIS has now become part of the worldwide EuropeAid programme. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU Seventh Framework Programme</ENAMEX>(FP7) sponsors research conducted by consortia from all EU members to work towards a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Research Area</ENAMEX>. 
Internal market 
Main article: Internal Market ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>) 
 
EU Member States have a standardised passport design with the name of the member state, a symbol, and the words "European Union" given in their official language(s). 
( <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ireland</ENAMEX>model) 
Two of the original core objectives of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Economic Community</ENAMEX>were the development of a common market, subsequently renamed the single market, and a customs union between its member states. 
The single market involves the free circulation of goods, capital, people and services within the EU, and the customs union involves the application of a common external tariff on all goods entering the market. 
Once goods have been admitted into the market they cannot be subjected to customs duties, discriminatory taxes or import quotas, as they travel internally. 
The non-EU member states of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iceland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Norway</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Liechtenstein</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX>participate in the single market but not in the customs union. 
Half the trade in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>is covered by legislation harmonised by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>. 
Free movement of capital is intended to permit movement of investments such as property purchases and buying of shares between countries. 
Until the drive towards Economic and Monetary Union the development of the capital provisions had been slow. 
Post-Maastricht there has been a rapidly developing corpus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECJ</ENAMEX>judgements regarding this initially neglected freedom. 
The free movement of capital is unique insofar as it is granted equally to non-member states. 
The free movement of persons means that EU citizens can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country. 
This required the lowering of administrative formalities and recognition of professional qualifications of other states. 
The free movement of services and of establishment allows self-employed persons to move between member states to provide services on a temporary or permanent basis. 
While services account for 60–70% of GDP, legislation in the area is not as developed as in other areas. 
This lacuna has been addressed by the recently passed Directive on services in the internal market which aims to liberalise the cross border provision of services. 
According to the Treaty the provision of services is a residual freedom that only applies if no other freedom is being exercised. 
Competition 
Further information: European Union competition law and European Commissioner for Competition 
 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>operates a competition policy intended to ensure undistorted competition within the single market. 
The Commission as the competition regulator for the single market is responsible for antitrust issues, approving mergers, breaking up cartels, working for economic liberalisation and preventing state aid. 
The Competition Commissioner, currently Joaquín Almunia, is one of the most powerful positions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>, notable for the ability to affect the commercial interests of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">trans</ENAMEX>-national corporations. 
For example, in 2001 the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>for the first time prevented a merger between two companies based in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX>and Honeywell) which had already been approved by their national authority. 
Another high profile case against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>, resulted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>fining Microsoft over €777 million following nine years of legal action. 
Monetary union 
Main articles: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economic</ENAMEX>and Monetary Union of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>and Eurozone 
 
The eurozone (in darker blue) is constituted by 17 member states adopting the euro as legal tender. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Central Bank</ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX>governs the monetary policy. 
The creation of a European single currency became an official objective of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Economic Community</ENAMEX>in 1969. 
However, it was only with the advent of the Maastricht Treaty in 1993 that member states were legally bound to start the monetary union no later than 1 January 1999. 
On this date the euro was duly launched by eleven of the then 15 member states of the EU. 
It remained an accounting currency until 1 January 2002, when euro notes and coins were issued and national currencies began to phase out in the eurozone, which by then consisted of 12 member states. 
The eurozone (constituted by the EU member states which have adopted the euro) has since grown to 17 countries, the most recent being Estonia which joined on 1 January 2011. 
All other EU member states, except <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denmark</ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>, are legally bound to join the euro when the convergence criteria are met, however only a few countries have set target dates for accession. 
Sweden has circumvented the requirement to join the euro by not meeting the membership criteria. 
The euro is designed to help build a single market by, for example: easing travel of citizens and goods, eliminating exchange rate problems, providing price transparency, creating a single financial market, price stability and low interest rates, and providing a currency used internationally and protected against shocks by the large amount of internal trade within the eurozone. 
It is also intended as a political symbol of integration and stimulus for more. 
Since its launch the euro has become the second reserve currency in the world with a quarter of foreign exchanges reserves being in euro. 
The euro, and the monetary policies of those who have adopted it in agreement with the EU, are under the control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Central Bank</ENAMEX>(ECB). 
The ECB is the central bank for the eurozone, and thus controls monetary policy in that area with an agenda to maintain price stability. 
It is at the centre of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European System</ENAMEX>of Central Banks, which comprehends all EU national central banks and is controlled by its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Council</ENAMEX>, consisting of the President of the ECB, who is appointed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Council</ENAMEX>, the Vice-President of the ECB, and the governors of the national central banks of all 27 EU member states. 
Financial supervision 
 
The European System of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Supervisors</ENAMEX>is an institutional architecture of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>'s framework of financial supervision composed by three authorities: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Banking Authority</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority</ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Securities and Markets Authority</ENAMEX>. 
To complement this framework, there is also a European Systemic Risk Board under the responsibility of the ECB. 
The aim of this financial control system is to ensure the economic stability of the EU. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy</ENAMEX>Main article: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy</ENAMEX>policy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union 
 
EU</ENAMEX>energy production 
46% of total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>primary energy use 
Nuclear energy	29.3% 
Coal & lignite	21.9% 

Gas	19.4% 
Renewable energy	14.6% 
Oil	13.4% 
Other	1.4% 
Net imports of energy 
54% of total primary EU energy use 
Oil & petroleum products	60.2% 

Gas	26.4% 
Other	13.4% 
In 2006, the 27 member states of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>had a gross inland energy consumption of 1,825 million tonnes of oil equivalent (toe). 
Around 46% of the energy consumed was produced within the member states while 54% was imported. 
In these statistics, nuclear energy is treated as primary energy produced in the EU, regardless of the source of the uranium, of which less than 3% is produced in the EU. 
The EU has had legislative power in the area of energy policy for most of its existence; this has its roots in the original European Coal and Steel Community. 
The introduction of a mandatory and comprehensive European energy policy was approved at the meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Council</ENAMEX>in October 2005, and the first draft policy was published in January 2007. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>has five key points in its energy policy: increase competition in the internal market, encourage investment and boost interconnections between electricity grids; diversify energy resources with better systems to respond to a crisis; establish a new treaty framework for energy co-operation with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>while improving relations with energy-rich states in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Asia</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Africa</ENAMEX>; use existing energy supplies more efficiently while increasing use of renewable energy; and finally increase funding for new energy technologies. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>currently imports 82% of its oil, 57% of its gas and 97.48% of its uranium demands. 
There are concerns that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s dependence on Russian energy is endangering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX>and its member countries. 
The EU is attempting to diversify its energy supply. 
Infrastructure

The Öresund Bridge between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denmark</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sweden</ENAMEX>is part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans-European Networks</ENAMEX>. 
The EU is working to improve cross-border infrastructure within the EU, for example through the Trans-European Networks (TEN). 
Projects under TEN include the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Channel Tunnel</ENAMEX>, LGV Est, the Fréjus Rail Tunnel, the Öresund Bridge, the Brenner Base Tunnel and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strait of Messina</ENAMEX>Bridge. 
In 2001 it was estimated that by 2010 the network would cover: 75,200 kilometres (46,700 mi) of roads; 78,000 kilometres (48,000 mi) of railways; 330 airports; 270 maritime harbours; and 210 internal harbours. 
The developing European transport policies will increase the pressure on the environment in many regions by the increased transport network. 
In the pre-2004 EU members, the major problem in transport deals with congestion and pollution. 
After the recent enlargement, the new states that joined since 2004 added the problem of solving accessibility to the transport agenda. 
The Polish road network in particular was in poor condition: at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>'s accession to the EU, 4,600 roads needed to be upgraded to EU standards, demanding approximately €17 billion.[not

The Galileo positioning system is another EU infrastructure project . 
Galileo is a proposed Satellite navigation system, to be built by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>and launched by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Space Agency</ENAMEX>(ESA), and is to be operational by 2012. 
The Galileo project was launched partly to reduce the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>'s dependency on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US-</ENAMEX>operated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Global Positioning System</ENAMEX>, but also to give more complete global coverage and allow for far greater accuracy, given the aged nature of the GPS system. 
It has been criticised by some due to costs, delays, and their perception of redundancy given the existence of the GPS system. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agriculture</ENAMEX>Main article: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Common Agricultural Policy 
 
EU</ENAMEX>farms are supported by the CAP, the largest budgetary expenditure. 
(Vineyard in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>) 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Common Agricultural Policy</ENAMEX>(CAP) is one of the oldest policies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX>, and was one of its core aims. 
The policy has the objectives of increasing agricultural production, providing certainty in food supplies, ensuring a high quality of life for farmers, stabilising markets, and ensuring reasonable prices for consumers. 
It was, until recently, operated by a system of subsidies and market intervention. 
Until the 1990s, the policy accounted for over 60% of the then European Community's annual budget, and still accounts for around 34%. 
The policy's price controls and market interventions led to considerable overproduction, resulting in so-called butter mountains and wine lakes. 
These were intervention stores of produce bought up by the Community to maintain minimum price levels. 
In order to dispose of surplus stores, they were often sold on the world market at prices considerably below Community guaranteed prices, or farmers were offered subsidies (amounting to the difference between the Community and world prices) to export their produce outside the Community. 
This system has been criticised for under-cutting farmers outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, especially those in the developing world. 
The overproduction has also been criticised for encouraging environmentally unfriendly intensive farming methods. 
Supporters of CAP say that the economic support which it gives to farmers provides them with a reasonable standard of living, in what would otherwise be an economically unviable way of life. 
However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>'s small farmers receive only 8% of CAP's available subsidies. 
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAP</ENAMEX>has been subject to a series of reforms. 
Initially these reforms included the introduction of set-aside in 1988, where a proportion of farm land was deliberately withdrawn from production, milk quotas (by the McSharry reforms in 1992) and, more recently, the 'de-coupling' (or disassociation) of the money farmers receive from the EU and the amount they produce (by the Fischler reforms in 2004). 
Agriculture expenditure will move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce, toward direct payments based on farm size. 
This is intended to allow the market to dictate production levels, while maintaining agricultural income levels. 
One of these reforms entailed the abolition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>'s sugar regime, which previously divided the sugar market between member states and certain <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">African</ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>nations with a privileged relationship with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU. 
 
Education and</ENAMEX>science 
Main articles: Educational policies and initiatives of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>and Framework Programmes for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research and Technological Development 
 
Renewable</ENAMEX>energy is one priority in transnational research activities such as the FP7 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education</ENAMEX>and science are areas where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>'s role is limited to supporting national governments. 
In education, the policy was mainly developed in the 1980s in programmes supporting exchanges and mobility. 
The most visible of these has been the Erasmus Programme, a university exchange programme which began in 1987. 
In its first 20 years it has supported international exchange opportunities for well over 1.5 million university and college students and has become a symbol of European student life. 
There are now similar programmes for school pupils and teachers, for trainees in vocational education and training, and for adult learners in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lifelong Learning Programme</ENAMEX>2007–2013. 
These programmes are designed to encourage a wider knowledge of other countries and to spread good practices in the education and training fields across the EU. 
Through its support of the Bologna process the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>is supporting comparable standards and compatible degrees across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. 
Scientific development is facilitated through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>'s Framework Programmes, the first of which started in 1984. 
The aims of EU policy in this area are to co-ordinate and stimulate research. 
The independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Research Council</ENAMEX>allocates EU funds to European or national research projects. 
The Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) deals in a number of areas, for example energy where it aims to develop a diverse mix of renewable energy for the environment and to reduce dependence on imported fuels. 
Health care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Health Insurance Card</ENAMEX>. 
(French version pictured) 
Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>has no major competences in the field of health care, Article 35 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>affirms that "A high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities". 
All the member states have either publicly sponsored and regulated universal health care or publicly provided universal health care. 
The public plans in some countries provide basic or "sick" coverage only; their citizens can purchase supplemental insurance for additional coverage. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Commission</ENAMEX>'s Directorate-General for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health</ENAMEX>and Consumers seeks to align national laws on the protection of people's health, on the consumers' rights, on the safety of food and other products. 
Health care in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>is provided through a wide range of different systems run at the national level. 
The systems are primarily publicly funded through taxation (universal health care). 
Private funding for health care may represent personal contributions towards meeting the non-taxpayer refunded portion of health care or may reflect totally private (non-subsidised) health care either paid out of pocket or met by some form of personal or employer funded insurance. 
All EU and many other European countries offer their citizens a free European <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Insurance</ENAMEX>Card which, on a reciprocal basis, provides insurance for emergency medical treatment insurance when visiting other participating European countries. 
A specific directive, the Directive on cross-border healthcare, aims at promoting cooperation on health care between member states and facilitating access to safe and high-quality cross-border healthcare for European patients. 
Demographics 
Main article: Demographics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>On 23 October 2010, the combined population of all 27 member states was forecast at 501,064,211 as of 1 January 2010.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>is home to more global cities than any other region in the world. 
It contains 16 cities with populations of over one million, the largest being <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>. 
Besides many large cities, the EU also includes several densely populated regions that have no single core but have emerged from the connection of several cites and now encompass large metropolitan areas. 
The largest are Rhine-Ruhr having approximately 11.5 million inhabitants ( <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cologne</ENAMEX>, Dortmund, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Düsseldorf</ENAMEX>et al.), Randstad approx. 
7 million ( <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amsterdam</ENAMEX>, Rotterdam, The Hague, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Utrecht</ENAMEX>et al.), Frankfurt/Rhine-Main approx. 
5.8 million ( <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wiesbaden</ENAMEX>et al.), the Flemish diamond approx. 
5.5 million (urban area in between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Antwerp</ENAMEX>, Brussels, Leuven and Ghent), the Øresund Region approx. 
3.7 million ( <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Copenhagen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denmark</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Malmö</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sweden</ENAMEX>), and the Upper Silesian Industrial Region approx. 
3.5 million (Katowice, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sosnowiec</ENAMEX>et al.) 
In 2010, 47.3 million people lived in the EU, who were born outside their resident country. 
This corresponds to 9.4% of the total EU population. 
Of these, 31.4 million (6.3%) were born outside the EU and 16.0 million (3.2%) were born in another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>member state. 
The largest absolute numbers of people born outside the EU were in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>(6.4 million), <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>(5.1 million), the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>(4.7 million), <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>(4.1 million), <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>(3.2 million), and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">the Netherlands</ENAMEX>(1.4 million).

Survey conducted in 2005, based on population with a minimum age of 15. 
Native: Native language 
Total: EU citizens able to hold a conversation in this language 
 
Among the many languages and dialects used in the EU, it has 23 official and working languages: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bulgarian</ENAMEX>, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Irish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish, and Swedish. 
Important documents, such as legislation, are translated into every official language. 
The European Parliament provides translation into all languages for documents and its plenary sessions. 
Some institutions use only a handful of languages as internal working languages. 
Catalan, Galician, Basque, Scottish Gaelic and Welsh are not official languages of the EU but have semi-official status in that official translations of the treaties are made into them and citizens of the EU have the right to correspond with the institutions using them. 
Language policy is the responsibility of member states, but EU institutions promote the learning of other languages. 
English is the most spoken language in the EU and is spoken by 51% of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>population counting both native and non-native speakers. 
German is the most widely spoken mother tongue (about 88.7 million people as of 2006). 
56% of EU citizens are able to engage in a conversation in a language other than their mother tongue. 
Most official languages of the EU belong to the Indo-European language family, except Estonian, Finnish, and Hungarian, which belong to the Uralic language family, and Maltese, which is an Afroasiatic language. 
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>official languages are written in the Latin alphabet except Bulgarian, written in Cyrillic, and Greek, written in the Greek alphabet. 
Besides the 23 official languages, there are about 150 regional and minority languages, spoken by up to 50 million people. 
Of these, only the Spanish regional languages (that is, Catalan, Galician, and the non-Indo-European Basque), Scottish Gaelic, and Welsh can be used by citizens in communication with the main European institutions. 
Although EU programmes can support regional and minority languages, the protection of linguistic rights is a matter for the individual member states. 
The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages ratified by most EU states provides general guidelines that states can follow to protect their linguistic heritage. 
Religion 
Main article: Religion in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>The percentage of Europeans in each member state who believe in "a God". 
The EU is a secular body with no formal connection with any religion, but Article 17 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>recognises the "status under national law of churches and religious associations" as well as that of "philosophical and non-confessional organisations". 
The preamble to the Treaty on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">European Union</ENAMEX>mentions the "cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe"</ENAMEX>. 
Discussion over the draft texts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Constitution</ENAMEX>and later the Treaty of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lisbon</ENAMEX>included proposals to mention Christianity or "God" or both, in the preamble of the text, but the idea faced opposition and was dropped. 
Christians in the EU are divided among followers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman Catholicism</ENAMEX>, numerous Protestant denominations (especially in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>), and Orthodoxy (in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greece</ENAMEX>, Cyprus, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bulgaria</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Romania</ENAMEX>). 
Other religions, such as Islam and Judaism, are also represented in the EU population. 
As of 2009, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>had an estimated Muslim population of 13 million, and an estimated Jewish population of over a million. 
Eurostat's Eurobarometer opinion polls showed in 2005 that 52% of EU citizens believed in a god, 27% in "some sort of spirit or life force", and 18% had no form of belief. 
Many countries have experienced falling church attendance and membership in recent years. 
The countries where the fewest people reported a religious belief were Estonia (16%) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Czech Republic</ENAMEX>(19%). 
The most religious countries are Malta (95%; predominantly Roman Catholic), and Cyprus and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Romania</ENAMEX>both with about 90% of the citizens believing in God (both predominantly <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Orthodox</ENAMEX>). 
Across the EU, belief was higher among women, increased with age, those with religious upbringing, those who left school at 15 with a basic education, and those "positioning themselves on the right of the political scale (57%)." 
Culture and sport 
Main articles: Cultural policies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>and Sport policies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union 
 
Turku</ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Finland</ENAMEX>(left) and Tallinn in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Estonia</ENAMEX>(right) are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Capitals of Culture</ENAMEX>in 2011 
Cultural co-operation between member states has been a concern of the EU since its inclusion as a community competency in the Maastricht Treaty. 
Actions taken in the cultural area by the EU include the Culture 2000 7-year programme, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Cultural Month</ENAMEX>event, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media Plus</ENAMEX>programme, orchestras such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union Youth Orchestra</ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Capital of Culture</ENAMEX>programme – where one or more cities in the EU are selected for one year to assist the cultural development of that city. 
Sport is mainly the responsibility of an individual member states or other international organisations rather than that of the EU. 
However, there are some EU policies that have had an impact on sport, such as the free movement of workers which was at the core of the Bosman ruling, which prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with European citizenship. 
The Treaty of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lisbon</ENAMEX>requires any application of economic rules to take into account the specific nature of sport and its structures based on voluntary activity. 
This followed lobbying by governing organisations such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Olympic Committee</ENAMEX>and FIFA, due to objections over the applications of free market principles to sport which led to an increasing gap between rich and poor clubs. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>does fund a program for Israeli, Jordanian, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Irish</ENAMEX>and British football coaches, as part of the Football 4 Peace project.
